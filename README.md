# Pixel Converter

![CSS fonts](https://cdn.frontify.com/assets/blog/blog-post-teaser-relative-font-sizes-for-web-designers.jpg)

Here is a simple Ruby program that converts pixel measurements in `css`/`scss`/&c files to whatever unit you want. The motivation behind this was specifically for converting to `rem`, but it could be used for `em`, `%`, and other CSS units as well.

## Setup

To get your machine and this code friendly and acquainted:

Clone this repository using your preferred method and `cd` into it. If you're not sure, I
recommend the SSH route:

```
git clone git@github.com:tmikeschu/pixel_converter.git
cd pixel_converter
bundle
```

## Testing

First things first: get a dopamine hit from a verdant test suite! Run the tests with:

```
clear && rspec
```

Then *read* the tests to get oriented with the application.

## Stack

Languages: Ruby
Major Libraries: RSpec

## Style

When contributing to code, be the tofu. In other words, take on the style of the
existing code. Here are some main approaches I follow:
